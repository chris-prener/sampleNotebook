## Introduction
This notebook models the submission process for assignments in all of my `R` based courses ([SOC 4930 & SOC5050](https://slu-soc5050.github.io) and [SOC 4650 & SOC 5650](https://slu-soc5650.github.io)). 

## Project Set Up
Before proceeding, we'll make sure our notebook is set up to work with our project data structure.

```{r setup}
knitr::opts_knit$set(root.dir = here::here())
```

This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
